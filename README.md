my first repository YAY

Hello out there

Selena here! So my academic background (late 90s) is/was actually in Neuroscience.  This was when I first became fascinated by AI, specifically neural networks and perceptual robotics.  Unfortunately when I gradudated, the only AI jobs available were in research labs.  After 17 yrs in corporate, wandering my way from C++/Java developer to business analyst and into business intelligence, I've decided to return back to where my most passionate curiosity first began.  And here I am...very excited!
